# General Questions

## 🧾 Purpose

This section groups short, self‑contained answers to the most frequent platform questions—so you can unblock yourself without opening a ticket. For deeper debugging or platform issues, see: Where to Get Help.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your question involves outages, billing discrepancies, or security concerns, escalate via modmail (direct staff ticket) instead of relying on these pages.
{% endhint %}
