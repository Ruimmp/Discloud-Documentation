## 💡 What's required

No matter what framework you use:

- **Port 8080** – Your app listens here. That's how traffic gets routed.
- **Subdomain** – [Create one following this guide](../../faq/general-questions/how-to-create-a-subdomain.md).
- **`discloud.config`** – Goes in your project root. [See the config guide](../../configurations/discloud.config/README.md).
- **Dependencies file** – `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, whatever your framework uses.
